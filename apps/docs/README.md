# Apps/docs (Starlight) – Coming Soon

This directory will host the Starlight documentation site for n00plicate 2.0. The site will compose the Markdown
content from `docs/` with interactive Storybook embeds, API tables, and telemetry dashboards. Until the
sprint dedicated to docs (Sprint 6) kicks off, this folder remains a placeholder.
